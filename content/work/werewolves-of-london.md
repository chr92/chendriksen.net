# Werewolves of London

"From the creators of Big Zeus Energy (nominated for Best Debut Show 2023, Leicester Comedy Festival; sell-out five-star show, Edinburgh Fringe 2023) a new work-in-progress clown and physical-comedy show that may be about werewolves. Praise for previous shows: 'A loud, bombastic, hyper-macho parody of the modern man. It's bizarre and beautiful' ***** (TheCrumb.co.uk). 'It’s very funny, delightfully charming and has a real spirit of the fringe vibe' **** (MumbleComedy.net)."

The second show from the group Big Zeus Energy, performed at Brighton Fringe, Edinburgh Fringe, Leicester Comedy Festival, Prague Comedy festival and further shows across Europe.
